Corso is the first open-source tool that aims to assist IT admins with the critical task of protecting their
Microsoft 365 data. It provides a reliable, secure, and efficient data protection engine. Admins decide where to store
the backup data and have the flexibility to perform backups of their desired service through an intuitive interface.
As Corso evolves, it can become a great building block for more complex data protection workflows.

**Corso is currently in Beta.**

Corso supports M365 Exchange and OneDrive with SharePoint and Teams support in active development. Coverage for more
services, possibly beyond M365, will expand based on the interest and needs of the community.
